* 你的代码中是否有一种模式存在？
  * [The Zen of ZMQ](zguide.zeromq.org/page:all)

* 你知道程序为什么要这样运行吗？
  * I'd like to build firmware on the fly, but all of them seems work on gentoo, not on other plantform such like ubuntu, and i encountered a wired question is when configurate auto generate makefile by the parameters, cuz the path of cross-compile order is higher than system, one of command `gawk` in cross-compile cross-compile rely on LIBC1.15 but in ubuntu 10.04, the hightest version is 1.12(just i know). so i spend a lot of time to compile it and try the wat i could, but it simply that remove gwak in cross-compile folder and that configurate find the system one :(

  * Another question is not found rpl_realloc and rpl_malloc, but based on [this](http://chunchaichang.blogspot.tw/2014/01/undefined-reference-to-rplmalloc.html) just add --with-gnu-ld in libjson configurate.

  * At least, it's strange when i cross compile in libssl-1.0.2, it ALWAYS said that md5 or xxx not found at the end of all of objects are linked. Once i seem it, i search in Google and try to remove my make option `-j4` that could be a bug in this version, after i remove addional option, the bug still in there :(

* 你知道这种技术的出处吗？
  * python

* 我喜欢现在所做的吗？
  * if i have more free time to survey other interesting.

* 这些代码还可以用在其它地方吗？
  * yes, it will be the awesome practice

* 今天有什么做错的吗？
  * too cranky today

* 难道真的没有办法吗？
  * calmcool-headed 

* 我可以向谁学习？
  * manager
