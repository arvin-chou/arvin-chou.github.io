* 你知道程序为什么要这样运行吗？
  * i have no idea how to use p4 command line to sync the exist workspace, cuz the client always show "Request too large (over 500000); see 'p4 help maxresults'." in it on max os, i don;t know how to use `/Applications/p4v.app/Contents/MacOS/p4v` to excute command, finally, i download from website that support command line binary code to excute some command, such like `P4PORT=p4:1666 ~/p4 -u myname -c myworkspace sync //depo
  * i found that lazy-load could improve the render performace notablly, maybe u could take a look in [here](https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload/blob/master/jquery.lazyload.js)
  * we can our code via klocwork, it shows its report friendly that we could locate the error quickly and correctly :)

* 你知道这种技术的出处吗？
  * python

  * if i have more free time to survey other interesting.

* 这些代码还可以用在其它地方吗？
