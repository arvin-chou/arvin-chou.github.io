* 你的代码中是否有一种模式存在？
  * [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

* 你知道程序为什么要这样运行吗？
  * I encounter the question it that the application is always segement fault in a streng point. And I try every ways to verify the suspicious point to debug, such as 
    * the ioctl consistency in user space and kernel space.
    * user space parsing buffer when get from ioctl and copy buffer to sqlit.

  Finnaly, when we save data to sqlite, we will translate id to name and its relationsips was saved in link-list. But lack cleanly logical in inital design, the original logical pseudocode code as below:
~~~
  //init_db(); // read file and transfer to link-list struct for id-name mapping.
  get_ioctldata(); // get iotcl data
  set_tosqlite(); // save data to sqlite.
~~~

  someone mark init_db function and not use macro to switch it, just for workaround and no one want to maintain it, unfortunally it was reported by customer and this bug was revealed. I thought the its not carefully and not famaliy with design pattern.

* 你知道这种技术的出处吗？
  * python

* 我喜欢现在所做的吗？
  * if i have more free time to survey other interesting.

* 这些代码还可以用在其它地方吗？
  * yes, it will be the awesome practice

* 今天有什么做错的吗？
  * too cranky today

* 难道真的没有办法吗？
  * calmcool-headed 

* 我可以向谁学习？
  * manager
