* 你知道程序为什么要这样运行吗？
  * i saw the "Double Checked Locking" as below:
  """
if (searchBox == null) {
                synchronized (SearchBox.class) {
                    if (searchBox == null) {
                        searchBox = new SearchBox();
                    }
                }
            }
  """, however, i don't understand why it need two if condition
    * [this article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18093735/double-checked-locking-in-singleton/18093774#18093774) share the answer:
"""
The Double checked pattern is used to avoid obtaining the lock everytime the code is executed, if the call are not happening together then the first condition will fail and the code execution will not execute the locking thus saving resources.
"""
  * i want to write regular express about prevent XSS attach, moreover, i want to figure out how to implement $.text() function in Jquery, which use `createTextNode` to implement it, so i try to find the function defination from Geoko source code.

  * yes, it will be the awesome practice

* 今天有什么做错的吗？
  * too cranky today
