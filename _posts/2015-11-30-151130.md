* 你知道程序为什么要这样运行吗？
  * i encounter a wired question about 4 threads use the one share resource, the snippest as below:
  * threadA1, threadB1 are preprocess functions that could insert something into list
  threadA2, threadB2 are end functions that could remove something from list
  their all share one resource: list. once i use mutex lock, it alwayse wait resource like:
    * threadA1 hold resouce 
    * threadA1 release it and threadA2 hold it immediently. 
    * threadB1 starve
  * i have no idea how to avoid it, one the possible solution is use array rather than list.

* 你知道这种技术的出处吗？
  * python

* 我喜欢现在所做的吗？
  * if i have more free time to survey other interesting.

* 这些代码还可以用在其它地方吗？
  * yes, it will be the awesome practice

* 今天有什么做错的吗？
  * too cranky today

* 难道真的没有办法吗？
  * calmcool-headed 

* 我可以向谁学习？
